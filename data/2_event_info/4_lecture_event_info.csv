In Conversation: Tift Merritt & Allison Russell,"Hungry River is a performance collaboration between Tift Merritt, Allison Russell (Our Native Daughters, Birds of Chicago) and playwright and cultural worker Nina Angela Mercer, exploring the emotional history of North Carolina's segregated asylum and the prophetic importance of the people who lived their lives there.  Through song and monologue, ceremony and storytelling, this community history helps us understand not only the asylum's past but also how that past informs the ways we view race relations, poverty, criminalized margins, and the stigma of mental illness today.Hungry River began as a collection of objects — a language of abandoned essential knowledge — from asylums across NC.  Within were much more than the simplistic diagnoses left in medical archives —  sickness, heartbreak, poverty, loss of a child, the war, pregnancy —but appropriate responses to a mad flawed world.  A young woman's grave covered in pine branches, a photograph of a WWI veteran in a velvet suit, the hospital brass band, river roots from an unmarked graveyard, a moth caught for decades in an intake record — Hungry River travels lyrical presences in archived materials, buildings, collective memory and a forgotten box of photographs seeking how best to reconnect and care for lost stories.As part of Duke Performances' and Duke Arts' In Conversation series this spring, the artists will offer an introduction to the many components of Hungry River. This work-in-process showing functions as the first of many invitations for shared narrative and community response — a framework and sounding call for this site as catalysts for art and study and a rare opportunity to explore memory, trauma and resilience.Friday, April 16, 202112-1 PM ETVimeo (https://vimeo.com/event/563246/c8d86303dc)Free and open to the publicNo registration required",Lecture/Talk,4,Duke Performances,"Fri, Apr 16, 2021",12 PM – 1 PM EDT (GMT-4),Vimeo,https://dukegroups.com/events/rsvp?id=1024740

DUU Speakers & Stage presents 'The Thirst Project',"DUU Speakers & Stage is thrilled to host 'The Thirst Project' in an effort to raise awareness surrounding water conservation and what we can do in our day-to-day lives to protect this natural resource as our world continues to change. Join us on Zoom on Sunday, January 24, at 8pm EST for this impactful and engaging event!More about 'Thirst Project:'""Thirst Project is a nonprofit organization that works with the support of young people to END the global water crisis by building freshwater wells in developing communities that need safe, clean drinking water. Why Water? Health and Sanitation: Waterborne diseases kill more children every single year than HIV, Malaria, and all world violence combined. Small children typically do not have strong enough immune systems to fight diseases like cholera, dysentery, or schistosomiasis.By providing a community with safe drinking water, disease rates can drop by up to 88% virtually overnight! Child mortality rates can drop up to 90%- overnight! Clean water also plays an incredibly critical role in effectively treating and managing HIV/AIDS in rural communities. The Kingdom of eSwatini, for example, has the single-highest-density population of HIV/AIDS in the world. For a person with HIV/AIDS, even if you have access to medical treatment or antiretroviral medication, but are still forced to drink dirty water from contaminated sources, the diseases in the water you drink will actually kill you faster than AIDS itself.Women and children spend on average six to eight hours each day walking to fetch water.

On Shab-e-Yalda, people gather in groups of friends or relatives usually at the home of grandparents or the elderly to pass the longest night of the year happily by eating nuts and fruits, reading Hafiz poems, making good wishes, and talking and laughing all together to give a warm welcome to winter, and a felicitous farewell to autumn.For the Yalda celebration event, we have Amir Koushkani and Saeed Farajpouri to perform music, Jane Lewisohn as Master of Ceremony, and Dr. Bathaee to talk about the historical facts of Yalda.",Lecture/Talk,4,Graduate Student Association of Iranians at Duke,"Sun, Dec 20, 2020",7 PM – 10:30 PM EST (GMT-5),Online Event,https://dukegroups.com/events/rsvp?id=889572

Dire Straits: Taiwan and the US-China Conflict,"Tensions between China and Taiwan have escalated since current President Tsai Ing-wen's re-election in 2020. Her Democratic Progressive Party has attempted to recenter Taiwan's focus away from cross-strait cooperation towards strengthening economic ties with other East Asian countries. This marks a departure from Taiwan's previous platform, developed by the rival Kuomintang Party, that emphasized friendlier relations with the mainland. Across the strait, China's President Xi Jinping has responded to Tsai's gradual decoupling with increased military demonstrations and more aggressive rhetoric. President Biden, meanwhile, has opted to continue the Trump-era prioritization of great power competition with China by increasing support for the island.To better understand each actor's motivation, their goals for the relationship, and the short and long-term future of the region, join the Alexander Hamilton Society on December 2nd at 7 PM ET in Physics 130 for a panel discussion featuring Ian Easton from the Project 2049 Institute and Emily Feng from NPR.",Lecture/Talk,4,The Alexander Hamilton Society,"Thu, Dec 2, 2021",7 PM – 8 PM EST (GMT-5),Private Location (sign in to display),https://dukegroups.com/events/rsvp?id=1379483

The Fight for Equality in Latin America How LGBTIQ+ Policymakers are advocating for change,"Although the extent of legal inequalities experienced by sexual and gender minorities has decreased over recent years in Latin America, LGBTIQ+ people still have fewer legal protections and benefits than the cisgender heterosexual population, due to a series of barriers that stand in the way of further progress. LGBTQ+ activists face backlash from social and religious conservatives, and some leaders, including presidents, are openly antagonistic towards LGBTQ+ rights. In some Latin American countries, Human Rights Watch has condemned ""discriminatory legislation"" that leaves LGBTQ+ people ""ready victims of discrimination, violence, and abuse."" The panel will discuss the situation of LGBTIQ+ rights in Latin American countries and the main initiatives of LGBTIQ+ policymakers from the region to address inequality and advocate for sexual and gender minorities' rights. The panel will also discuss the importance of representation and the role of social activists and local organizations to promote change, as well as provide their vision of the future.Speakers: Confirmed: ÔùÅ Alberto de BelaÔÇénde (in person): Peruvian lawyer, college teacher, and LGBTIQ+ rights advocate.

Speaker Event: Sumi Dutta,"To apologize on purpose is to know at our core that we are forgivable. In this workshop, we get to skill up on 'I'm sorry' and engage our longing to repair hurt feelings and harm inside our relationships. We'll explore why apologies are worth the risk, even or especially when we don't like the other person. More importantly, we'll get to encounter what it takes in us to ask to be forgiven (even if forgiveness never comes).Purposeful apologies can be small reparative actions which increase trust, safety, and connection in our interpersonal lives. Sharpening this skill as adults is one way we can build our muscle for taking accountability, as we fight for new ways of being which don't rely on prisons and policing to keep us safe.Come to this workshop with ""material"" to work with, meaning a personal situation where you want to practice making amends and feel comfortable sharing with another person.sumi (she/her) is an abolitionist community organizer, writer, and facilitator committed to politicized healing.

Speaker Event with Lisa Genova (Duke NeuroCare x Duke HAND),"This year, NeuroCare is looking to collaborate with Duke HAND to virtually host award-winning author, neuroscientist, and leading expert on Alzheimer's Dr. Lisa Genova to be our guest speaker for the semester.We are planning to virtually host Dr. Genova via Zoom with an in-person Duke audience. The intent of the event is to have an impactful, student-led conversation on the state of Alzheimer's research. Attached to this request is the contract I have generated with Dr. Genova's representative.For some more information about Dr. Genova you can read below:Dr. Lisa Genova authored Still Alice, a moving story about Alice Howland, a linguistics professor at Columbia who was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease at age 50. The story has since been adapted into an award-winning motion picture starring Julianne Moore, Kristen Stewart, and Alec Baldwin; Julianne Moore won an Oscar for her performance as Genova's character, testifying to the movie's success.Dr. Genova has written other contemporary fiction novels and has since been named the Oliver Sacks of neuroscience fiction. In 2021, she came out with ""The Science of Memory and the Art of Forgetting"" and it was an instant New York Times bestseller.As mentioned previously, Dr. Genova is a practicing neuroscientist herself; she graduated valedictorian of her class from Bates College with a degree in biopsychology and subsequently received a PhD in neuroscience from Harvard. Genova gives TedTalks on brain science, including one on the progression of Alzheimer's research which she delivered in 2017 and another titled ""How Memory Works (and Why Forgetting is Normal). Today, she conducts Alzheimer's research and is considered to be at the forefront of the field.We would love to get Dr. Genova to speak for Duke!

"Guest Speaker: Mr. Clarence Henderson, NC Civil Rights Icon","The Ciceronian Society is pleased to present NC civil rights icon Mr. Clarence Henderson as our first invitational speaker this Fall! In 1960, on the second day of the Greensboro sit-in, Joseph A. McNeil and Franklin E. McCain were joined by William Smith and Clarence Henderson at the Woolworth lunch counter in Greensboro, North Carolina. Clarence Henderson was in the forefront of the civil rights battle as he bravely stepped up to participate in the sit-in at the Woolworth's diner.In 2000, Mr. Henderson was the recipient of the 40th Anniversary Sit-In Participant Award and in 2013 he was appointed by Governor Pat McCrory, to the Chairman seat on the North Carolina Martin Luther King Jr. Commission. In addition, Governor McCrory conferred in 2016 The Order of the Long Leaf Pine Award to Mr. Henderson with the rank of Ambassador Extraordinary. Mr. Henderson was appointed President of the Frederick Douglass Foundation for the State of North Carolina in May 2017 of which he currently serves.Mr. Henderson's energetic involvement in his church as Head Elder, New Members Coordinator, Sunday school teacher, and Finance committee member; and his life's journey as a teacher, college administrator, entrepreneur and motivational speaker has given him a unique perspective on what confronts society today.While his life is chronicled with episodes of civil unrest in which he found himself thrust in the midst, he did his part to bring awareness and change in a peaceful manner. Clarence now champions a new cause for a better America by challenging, motivating and inspiring others to be aware and responsible for the world that surrounds them.Food Provided",Lecture/Talk,4,The Ciceronian Society,"Tue, Sep 12, 2023",6 PM – 7:15 PM EDT (GMT-4),Private Location (sign in to display),https://dukegroups.com/events/rsvp?id=2154049
