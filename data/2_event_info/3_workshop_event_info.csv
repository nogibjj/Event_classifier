You will delight in the condensed colorization and miniature size of your tiny art piece. Remember, anyone can make shrinkydinks, no matter their artistic level!

POETRY IN MUSIC,"Presented in Partnership with DukeCreate & DuWellInstructor: VaChikepe: The PoetAbout the WorkshopIn this workshop, students will be introduced to Leonard Dembo through his song, ""Munovenga Mudzimai Wangu"", which translates to ""You Don't Like My Wife"". According to The Herald, documenting the growth of music in Zimbabwe without mentioning Leonard Dembo would be incomplete. Dembo, who passed away on April 9, 1996, at the age of 37, was one of the greatest musicians to emerge from the country. His music addressed societal issues, including love, unity, and peace. Dembo is arguably the best musician to grace the Zimbabwean music scene. Listening to the depth of the above-mentioned song, I asked myself a question, ""Was Leonard Dembo a poet?"" Students will have the opportunity to listen to Dembo's song and extract abstract thoughts from it. They will also be provided with a translated version of the song and encouraged to create their own inspired written pieces. Students will then share their creations, and our guest poet will provide an interpretation of the song. This process aims to inspire students to discover poetry within music and all aspects of life, as a means to tap into the profound love that resides within us.",Workshop/Short Course,3,Duke Arts Create,"Wed, Sep 27, 2023",6 PM – 8 PM EDT (GMT-4),Private Location (sign in to display),https://dukegroups.com/events/rsvp?id=2198703
