Africa Policy Talks,"This this first edition of ""Africa Policy Talks"" coincides with the last day of the 27th Climate Summit (COP27), being hosted by Egypt (6th to 18th November). The COP27 agenda is focused around Climate Finance, Adaptation Efforts, Loss and Damage, and Increased Ambition. COP27 represents an opportunity for Africa to take center stage in shaping global climate negotiations to be better representative of Global South realities and needs. Africa Policy Talks seeks to facilitate dialogue between students and experts (within and outside the Duke community). We will discuss highlights from deliberations at COP27, climate action best practices from various contexts, opportunities for action and capacity development priorities.The Paris Agreement, adopted at COP21 in 2015, set a global goal to limit global warming to below 2 degree Celsius (1.5 preferably), compared to pre-industrial levels. At COP15 in 2009, developed countries pledged $100 billion annually in climate finance to developing countries by 2020. The timeline was extended to 2025 at COP21 in Paris. Till date, this target has never been met. No one feels these impacts more acutely than the more than 3.3 billion people living in countries highly vulnerable to climate change. The African continent is facing worsening economic conditions and consequences of the climate crisis – from deadly floods to crop-withering droughts – which are resulting in human displacements and huge humanitarian burdens. This is all happening despite being responsible for only 3% of carbon emissions. Meanwhile, over 750 million Africans lack access to electricity - while food insecurity, rising fuel prices, and increasing loss and damages put lives at risk.",Panel/Seminar/Colloquim,5,Duke Sanford Africa Policy Group,"Fri, Nov 18, 2022",1:30 PM – 3 PM EST (GMT-5),"Sanford 09, Sanford School of Public Policy",https://dukegroups.com/events/rsvp?id=1890301
