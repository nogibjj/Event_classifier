When his long-term relationship takes an unexpected turn, leaving him suddenly single, he discovers that finding someone who enjoys quiet evenings of cooking and conversation is challenging in a sea of guys who are focused on partying and hook-ups. But when Mo meets Kal, sparks fly, and the cute couple moves carefully into a romance that is sweet and complicated. True-to-life dialogue and richly complex and relatable characters breathe naturalistic energy into writer-director Mike Mosallam's gorgeously shot feature debut, which he expanded from his 2015 short of the same name.

les nuits de l'├óme (the nights of the soul) - Film Collection Night,"Cinema can fill empty spaces of your life and your loneliness.-Pedro AlmodovarIt is easy to lose yourself in the fantastical world of movies, with their giant explosions, quick action sequences, and exaggerated stakes. However, there are movies out there in which you find a part of yourself. The films that we are going to show this weekend belong to this category. The characters in these films are not particularly special. They are not the chosen ones. They do not possess superpowers. They are the ordinary people who pass by you in the street and stand behind you in the checkout line. They are you! And the stakes are not the fate of the universe or humanity. The stakes are the consequences of each choice made and each course of action taken. These films do not preach. They do not take pity. They do not attempt to stir an emotion in you or work too hard to move you. They just tell stories. The stories that bestow significance to our universal humanity.No registration required - we take walk-ins!

A Separation - Movie Screening at the Griffith Theater with the Persian Students Association!,"In a world where there is no right or wrong, in which there is always the chance that we have made or might make the incorrect choice, in which we have to live with these realizations, how should we decide on the choices we make?

However, it is unclear under whose custody the daughter should be placed. This film does not take sides and does not ask us to identify with either party. The audience – just like their daughter – must decide for themselves who they believe made the better choice, and whose side they are going to take.Come to the screening of A Separation to witness one of the best illustrations of the weight of making the right choice in the morally and emotionally ambiguous world of ordinary people.No registration required.

ASA ROOTing for You,"The ASA Bean and Sprout program is a great opportunity for freshmen (beans) to get involved with the ASA community and to bond with upperclassmen (sprouts)!

Pairings can form a garden with other bean and sprout pairs. Throughout the year, we will hold events where gardens compete to accrue as many seeds (points) to ""plant"" in their garden. How does a garden accrue seeds? For example, gardens can accrue seed by winning a board game match against another garden. The garden that manages to accrue the most seeds at the end of the year will receive a special prize.Everyone who applies will be able to rank their most preferred beans/sprouts. We will be hosting our first mingling event, ROOTing for You, on October  15th, from 12-2:PM! This is an introductory event for prospective bean and sprouts to meet each other--just bring yourself, and we'll provide the snacks and beverages! Following this event, we will have smaller events for y'all to get to know each other, but sprouts are also highly encouraged to host their own kickbacks.
