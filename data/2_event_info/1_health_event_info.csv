"Mindfulness: Tai Chi, Photography and The Present Moment with DukeArts","Photography and mindfulness have a deep and enduring relationship. In photography, we are asked to be fully present, to call upon all of the senses and to respond with a single image. In Taijiquan (Tai Chi) we engage with several invigorating practices to relax, listen, and improve our awareness of self and surroundings. This 1.5 hour long workshop brings both Tai Chi and photography together and teaches us how to enrich our ability to surrender to, be fully awake in and to capture the essence of the moment. We begin with Chi Gong exercises to bring us closer to defining ourselves and relaxing into stillness, from which we can listen, look, and act with increased precision and clarity. We take our cameras, with a new awareness, into our environment and culminate with a group share and discussion.Registration Required (https://duke.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJAqf-ytrT0uHddeVoQNvtgaEI0pu2KpkiJu)Info will be provided closer to the date on the DukeCreate website at https://arts.duke.edu/workshops/",Health/Wellness,1,Student Wellness Center,"Mon, Apr 12, 2021",4 PM – 5:30 PM EDT (GMT-4),Zoom,https://dukegroups.com/events/rsvp?id=1042699
